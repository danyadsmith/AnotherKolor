HTML code coloring for those who like their angle brackets and tag names to be the same color.

![Another Kolor (Dark) theme - CSS and Sass](screenshots/css_sass_dark.png)

CSS and Sass code coloring to highlight IDs, classes and elements with vibrant colors so they stand out in the editor and minimap. This is helpful if you calculate specificity points for style rules.

This is a BETA color scheme that I continue to edit and tweak as I use it over time. 

Another Kolor also includes configuration for the following Sublime Text packages:
