<h1>Another Kolor</h1>

<h2>A custom theme for Sublime Text 2/3</h2>

<p>In my development environment, I like to use the Dark version of a theme for code editing and the Light version of a theme for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plain Text files (<code>.txt</code>)</li>
<li>Markdown (<code>.mmd</code>, <code>.markdown</code>, <code>.md</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a sample <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> document to demonstrate <em>how text this theme works</em>.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at code coloring for block quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produced objects of beauty. A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist will enjoy what he does and will do it better.<br/>
- Donald Knuth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And code samples:</p>
<pre><code class="(null)">    while(!successful)
    {
        tryAgain();
        if(dead)
            break;
    }</code></pre>

<p>And more text.</p>
